# Netlify clone created with Create React App

Live link: [Foodie](https://localefoodie.netlify.app/)

This project is clone of Yelp's functionality using the Yelp fusion API.
I utilized serverless ( Netlify functions ) for the back-end functionality.
I also included Node JS back-end in the repository just for reference.
