# Yelp clone created with Create React App

Live link - Foodie(https://localefoodie.netlify.app)

This project is a clone of Yelp's functionality using the Yelp fusion API.
I utilized serverless ( Netlify functions ) for the back-end functionality.
I also included Node JS back-end ( proxy folder ) in the repository just for reference.
